# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the BrowserGuard application with a comprehensive browser-based debugging interface. Currently, the application has basic debug mode functionality that shows blocklist data, but it lacks detailed debugging capabilities for monitoring rules, time periods, browser status, and system logs in real-time. The enhanced debugging interface will provide developers and administrators with complete visibility into the application's operation through a web browser.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access a comprehensive debugging interface through my web browser, so that I can monitor and troubleshoot the BrowserGuard application without needing to access the Electron app directly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is started with debug mode enabled THEN the system SHALL expose a local HTTP server on a configurable port (default 3001)
2. WHEN I navigate to the debug URL in any browser THEN the system SHALL display a comprehensive debugging dashboard
3. WHEN the debug server is running THEN the system SHALL log the debug server URL to the application logs
4. IF the debug port is already in use THEN the system SHALL automatically try the next available port and log the actual port being used

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view current blocking rules and time periods in real-time, so that I can verify the application is using the correct configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the debug interface THEN the system SHALL display the current blocklist with all time periods and associated domains
2. WHEN the blocklist is updated from the remote API THEN the debug interface SHALL automatically refresh to show the new data
3. WHEN a time period is currently active THEN the system SHALL highlight it visually in the interface
4. WHEN no blocklist data is available THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message and show any error details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor browser activity and blocking events in real-time, so that I can see exactly what URLs are being checked and which ones are being blocked.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application polls browsers for URLs THEN the debug interface SHALL display the current URL from each supported browser (Chrome, Safari, Edge)
2. WHEN a domain is blocked THEN the system SHALL log the blocking event with timestamp, URL, and matching rule in the debug interface
3. WHEN a browser process is killed THEN the system SHALL log this action in the debug interface
4. WHEN no browsers are running or accessible THEN the system SHALL display appropriate status messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to view application logs and system status, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor the application's health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the debug interface THEN the system SHALL display recent application logs with timestamps
2. WHEN new log entries are created THEN the debug interface SHALL automatically update to show them
3. WHEN I access the debug interface THEN the system SHALL display system information including platform, accessibility permissions status, and application version
4. WHEN the application encounters errors THEN the system SHALL prominently display error information in the debug interface

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manually test blocking functionality, so that I can verify the application works correctly without waiting for natural blocking events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the debug interface THEN the system SHALL provide controls to manually trigger blocking checks for specific URLs
2. WHEN I enter a test URL THEN the system SHALL evaluate it against current rules and display whether it would be blocked
3. WHEN I trigger a manual block test THEN the system SHALL show which rule (if any) matched the URL and during which time period
4. WHEN I simulate a blocking event THEN the system SHALL allow me to test the warning popup without actually killing browser processes

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the debug interface to be responsive and user-friendly, so that I can efficiently navigate and use the debugging tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the debug interface THEN the system SHALL provide a clean, organized layout with clear sections for different types of information
2. WHEN I view the interface on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately
3. WHEN I interact with the interface THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback for all actions
4. WHEN data is loading or updating THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading indicators
